## swarm_instruct

Send an instruction to a running agent, a whole swarm, or all agents. Use this to:
- Relay instructions from the queen to a specific agent.
- Adjust an agent's focus mid-task.
- Coordinate between agents when hive-mind nudges aren't enough.

Target a specific agent by name (delivers to their inbox) or broadcast to all via the general channel.
