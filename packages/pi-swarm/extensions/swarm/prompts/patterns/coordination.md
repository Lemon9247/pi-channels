## Coordination

When multiple agents work in parallel, follow these patterns to avoid duplication and conflicts:

- **Check the hive-mind before starting work.** Another agent may have already posted findings relevant to your task.
- **Claim your area.** Post what you're working on in the hive-mind early so others know not to duplicate it.
- **When you receive a notification**, check the hive-mind — the sender found something that may affect your work.
- **Use targeted nudges** (the `to` field on `hive_notify`) when your finding is relevant to a specific agent, not everyone.
