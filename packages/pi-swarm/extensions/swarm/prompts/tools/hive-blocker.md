## hive_blocker

Signal that you're stuck on something that affects the swarm. Call this **immediately** when blocked — don't silently spin.

- This interrupts the queen so they can help.
- Also post the details in the Blockers section of the hive-mind file.
- Include a brief description of what's blocking you.
